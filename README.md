# Metadata-Stripper
A program written in PHP that takes an uploaded picture, saves it and reads it to display what the file has to offer. It will then display this to the user, giving the user the option to choose what tags they wish to remove. It will then remove the desired metadata, save the file and allow the user to re-download it.

## ToDo
- Upload to Github
- Make it work
- Create a UX/UI for webpage
